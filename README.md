The objective of this project is to design a simple 8-bit computer based on the architecture of SAP-1 using combinational and sequential circuits. The computer has the following main components:

• An 8-bit BUS

• Clock Module

• 16*8-bit RAM

• Program Counter

• Input Unit

• Memory Address Register (MAR)

• Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

• A-register and B-register

• Instruction Register

• Controller-sequencer

• Output Register

The main functions of the computer are:
